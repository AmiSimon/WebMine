# WebMine
A Minecraft web server panel made using Go and daisyUI.

## Build 
To build the project, you will need Go.

The istructions are for linux, so for Windows users, you need to adapt the commands.

First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Skyfield1888/WebMine.git && cd WebMine/
```

You should now be able to run the program using `go run .`
Note that the executable is not yet standalone.
